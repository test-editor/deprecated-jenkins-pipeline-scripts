<strong>getGithubUrlAsSsh()</strong>

<p>
Calls <pre>getGitUrl()</pre> and replaces "https://github.com/" by "git@github.com:".
This is useful as the GitHub plugin checks out the repository using HTTPS.<br/>
<br/>
In case we want to check-in something manually during a shell script, we want to use SSH for that.
